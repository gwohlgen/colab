Von Gardner was born into a family of Scottish ancestry on the family estate near Sevastopol, Crimea. He graduated Orthodox Theology at the University of Belgrade, after that he worked for a while as teacher in the Seminary of Cetinje and later on he took monastic vows and was given the name Filipp. In 1931 he was ordained priest serving in the Eastern part of Slovakia, between 1934 and 1938 he was the head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem. After his return he served a few years as parish priest in Berlin before he was consecrated bishop for the Russian Orthodox Church in Exile (ROCOR) in June 1942. On this occasion he was given the title \\\"Bishop of Potsdam\\\" thus being mainly responsible for the Russian Orthodox parishes of Berlin and Vienna. Yet in 1944 he had to leave holy orders and married shortly after - the exact circumstances how all this happened are not quite clear. After World War II he installed himself in the Bavarian spa town Bad Reichenhall situated not far from the Austrian border and became also choirmaster in one of the Russian Orthodox parishes of Salzburg which at that time were made up of refugees. In 1954 he was invited to the University of Munich as a lecturer of musicology hereby dealing especially with traditional Russian Chant, finally in 1965 he earned a doctorate and was subsequently given a professorship. After 1917, he spent four years living in Subcarpathian Rus and was particularly amazed at the religious knowledge of the simple peasants, acquired simply by singing in church.

Von Gardner was born into a family of Scottish ancestry on the family estate near Sevastopol, Crimea. He graduated Orthodox Theology at the University of Belgrade, after that he worked for a while as teacher in the Seminary of Cetinje and later on he took monastic vows and was given the name Filipp. In 1931 he was ordained priest serving in the Eastern part of Slovakia, between 1934 and 1938 he was the head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem. After his return he served a few years as parish priest in Berlin before he was consecrated bishop for the Russian Orthodox Church in Exile (ROCOR) in June 1942. On this occasion he was given the title \\\"Bishop of Potsdam\\\" thus being mainly responsible for the Russian Orthodox parishes of Berlin and Vienna. Yet in 1944 he had to leave holy orders and married shortly after - the exact circumstances how all this happened are not quite clear. After World War II he installed himself in the Bavarian spa town Bad Reichenhall situated not far from the Austrian border and became also choirmaster in one of the Russian Orthodox parishes of Salzburg which at that time were made up of refugees. In 1954 he was invited to the University of Munich as a lecturer of musicology hereby dealing especially with traditional Russian Chant, finally in 1965 he earned a doctorate and was subsequently given a professorship. After 1917, he spent four years living in Subcarpathian Rus and was particularly amazed at the religious knowledge of the simple peasants, acquired simply by singing in church.

In 1573 he published this new method of dissecting the brain whereby he separated the brain from the skull and began the dissection from the base.

Gil-Robles received his master's degree in 1919 and in 1922 he gained by examination the chair of political law in the University of La Laguna (Tenerife). During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera he was secretary of the Catholic-Agrarian National Confederation and member of the Writing Council of El Debate. After the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic, he participated in and led the Acci\\u00f3n Nacional (National Action) party, later renamed Acci\\u00f3n Popular (Popular Action). In the elections of 1931 he was chosen as a deputy in the Cortes for Salamanca. During the period of the Republic, he maintained the posture of \\\"accidentalism\\\": whether Spain was a monarchy or republic was less important than the law's compatibility with religious principles. Gil-Robles formed the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) which won the elections of November 1933. To avoid conflicts with leftist parties, President Niceto Alcal\\u00e1-Zamora invested Alejandro Lerroux, leader of the Radicals, as prime minister instead of Gil Robles, the head of the largest party in the Cortes. The appointment of three CEDA ministers to the cabinet in 1934 triggered the leftist miners' strike that rose against the government of the Republic. Gil-Robles served as Minister of War under Lerroux from May to December 1935.

He campaigned for a majority under the slogan Todo el poder para el Jefe (\\\"All the power to the Chief [i.e., Gil Robles]\\\"), and while he himself was reelected to the Cortes, the National Front narrowly lost the elections. Gil-Robles is a unique and controversial figure in the history of Spanish politics. The nature of his political beliefs during the Second Republic either greatly fluctuated or were tailored to his audience, as he is recorded as making many statements that appear contradictory. This is certainly reflected in the nature of his party, the CEDA, which somehow managed to attract support from both moderate Catholic republicans and extreme right-wing monarchists. The controversy surrounding him has been best articulated by historians Paul Preston and Richard Robinson: \\n* Preston believes that Gil-Robles was essentially a legalist fascist, whose policy of accidentalism would give way to legislating for a fascist dictatorship when he was confident that the populace was controllable. His evidence references Gil Robles' speeches, which were often filled with \\\"anti-democratic and anti-Semitic innuendo\\\", the oppressive, anti-reformist nature of his government partnership with Alejandro Lerroux's Radicals, and the frank admiration offered to foreign fascist regimes by both his propaganda and by his press organ, El Debate. \\n* Robinson, however, rejects any claim that Gil-Robles was anything but a consummate politician struggling to keep the unstable right under control and within the law. The CEDA was not a mere front for fascist aspirations, but a party that was based on Catholic values, including a desire to pursue social Catholicism. Gil Robles himself certainly expressed pro-republican views; in an interview with the American journalist Mallory Browne he said, \\\"I am the only friend of the Republic\\\", and is recorded as declaring that \\\"a new dictatorship would produce, after a period of tranquillity, social revolution.\\\" Following the victory of the Popular Front in the elections of February 1936 and the defeat of the CEDA, support for Gil-Robles and his party evaporated almost overnight.

Gil-Robles himself authorized the transfer of 500,000 pesetas of CEDA electoral funds to General Emilio Mola's military insurgents. Whatever his politics were, with the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Gil-Robles was unwilling to struggle with Francisco Franco for power and in April 1937 announced the dissolution of CEDA. After the Civil War he went into exile. Abroad he negotiated with Spanish monarchists to try to arrive at a common strategy for taking power in Spain. In 1968 he was named a professor of the University of Oviedo and published his book No fue posible la paz ('Peace Was Not Possible'). He was a member of the International Tribunal at the Hague.

He took part in World War II and joined the CPSU in 1943. Having settled to Estonia after the USSR annexed Estonia, Gustav Naan, a loyal communist and graduate of the Higher Party School of the AUCP(b) (1946). published a number of Stalinist-oriented polemic pieces (treating Estonian history and politics from the pro-Soviet perspective, e.g. \\u201cEesti kodanlike natsionalistide ideoloogia reaktsiooniline olemus\\u2033 ('The Reactionary Essence of the Ideology of Estonian Bourgeois Nationalists'), 1947).

From 1964, Naan worked at the Institute of Astrophysics and Atmosphere Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR. Having turned to theorizing on cosmology, cybernetics and demography, he often rejected taboos of both the 'traditional' world-view and orthodox communist opinions on such matters. He later claimed to have been one of the promoters of the theory of relativity at the time this was still considered pseudoscience by the Soviet authorities.

Reginald Bretnor himself was born in Vladivostok, Russia. He was married to Helen Harding, a translator and U.C. Berkeley librarian, from 1948 until her death in 1967. He subsequently married Rosalie, whom he referred to in a letter in the Southern Oregon Historical Society Archives as Rosalie McShane, although she wrote under the name Rosalie Bodrero. According to papers in the SOHS Archives, Bretnor\\u2019s military background included service in the last cavalry unit in the U.S. Army. Health issues led to his discharge in August 1941. He tried to reenlist in 1942, but was rejected. He was hired by the Office of War Intelligence to write propaganda to be sent to Japan, and papers related to his work are held in the SOHS Archives. After World War II, Bretnor worked for the U.S. State Department until ill health once again caused him to resign. He died, aged 80, in Medford, Oregon. In addition to wars, weaponry and science fiction, Bretnor\\u2019s interests included cats. He translated Les Chats, the first known book about cats, written by Augustin Paradis de Moncrif in 1727. He also wrote multiple articles about cats, always owned cats, and considered himself to have a psychic connection to cats. It has been alleged that Bretnor was an early associate of Anton Szandor LaVey in the days before the founding of the Church of Satan, and that Bretnor and other science fiction authors were members of LaVey's \\\"Order of the Trapezoid\\\" in the early 1950s.\", \"head\": \"Reginald Bretnor\", \"tail\": \"Medford, Oregon\", \"relation\": \"deathPlace\"}, {\"sentence\": \"Tom\\u00e1s Bret\\u00f3n y Hern\\u00e1ndez (Salamanca, 29 December 1850 \\u2013 Madrid, 2 December 1923) was a Spanish conductor and composer.\", \"head\": \"Tom\\u00e1s Bret\\u00f3n\", \"tail\": \"Madrid\", \"relation\": \"birthPlace\"}, {\"sentence\": \"Tom\\u00e1s Bret\\u00f3n y Hern\\u00e1ndez (Salamanca, 29 December 1850 \\u2013 Madrid, 2 December 1923) was a Spanish conductor and composer.\", \"head\": \"Tom\\u00e1s Bret\\u00f3n\", \"tail\": \"Madrid\", \"relation\": \"deathPlace\"}, {\"sentence\": \"Daniel B.

He knew more than 20 languages. Many literary works were successfully translated from the majority of these languages and introduced to the Ukrainian literature by him. The literary prize Ars Translationis has been instituted by \\\"Vsesvit\\\" since 1989 to commemorate Lukash. Lukash was born into a family of teachers. From childhood he picked up foreign languages with ease. He began studying at the History Faculty of the Kyiv State University, but his studies were interrupted by the Second World War. He fought in the Soviet Army from 1943. In 1947 after graduating from the Institute of Foreign Languages in Kharkiv, Lukash worked as a teacher of foreign languages. He then became head of the Department of Poetry for the journal \\u201cVsesvit\\u201d [\\u201cUniverse\\u201d]. Lukash was blessed with phenomenal linguistic talents and had an extraordinarily wide knowledge of foreign literature. He is considered to have been one of the most outstanding Ukrainian translators, translating literary works from 20 languages. He was also one of the figures who created an alternative Ukrainian culture. He was most prolific during the relatively favourable twenty-year period between 1953 and 1973, when he translated Goethe\\u2019s \\u201cFaust\\u201d, Flaubert\\u2019s \\u201cMadame Bovary\\u201d, the poetry of Schiller, Bocaccio\\u2019s \\u201cDecameron\\u201d and many other works. He was a member of the Union of Writers of Ukraine from 1956 and played an active role in Ukrainian literary life. Lukash always gave moral support to writers who were being oppressed. Then after the arrest of I.

He knew more than 20 languages. Many literary works were successfully translated from the majority of these languages and introduced to the Ukrainian literature by him. The literary prize Ars Translationis has been instituted by \\\"Vsesvit\\\" since 1989 to commemorate Lukash. Lukash was born into a family of teachers. From childhood he picked up foreign languages with ease. He began studying at the History Faculty of the Kyiv State University, but his studies were interrupted by the Second World War. He fought in the Soviet Army from 1943. In 1947 after graduating from the Institute of Foreign Languages in Kharkiv, Lukash worked as a teacher of foreign languages. He then became head of the Department of Poetry for the journal \\u201cVsesvit\\u201d [\\u201cUniverse\\u201d]. Lukash was blessed with phenomenal linguistic talents and had an extraordinarily wide knowledge of foreign literature. He is considered to have been one of the most outstanding Ukrainian translators, translating literary works from 20 languages. He was also one of the figures who created an alternative Ukrainian culture. He was most prolific during the relatively favourable twenty-year period between 1953 and 1973, when he translated Goethe\\u2019s \\u201cFaust\\u201d, Flaubert\\u2019s \\u201cMadame Bovary\\u201d, the poetry of Schiller, Bocaccio\\u2019s \\u201cDecameron\\u201d and many other works. He was a member of the Union of Writers of Ukraine from 1956 and played an active role in Ukrainian literary life. Lukash always gave moral support to writers who were being oppressed. Then after the arrest of I. DZIUBA, whom Lukash considered to be the most outstanding figure in Ukrainian culture, he sent a letter to the Head of the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR, the Head of the Ukrainian Supreme Court and the General Prosecutor of the Ukrainian SSR with a copy to the Presidium of the Administration of the Union of Writers of Ukraine, in which he disagreed with the court ruling, calling it unjust, protested against the expulsion of I.DZIUBA from the Union of Writers of Ukraine (UWU) and offered as a person living alone to serve the sentence instead of I.DZIUBA who was a family man and in bad health: \\u201cI humbly ask that you allow me to serve the period of imprisonment in his place...\\u201d This act cost Lukash dear.

After being expelled from medical school by the Japanese in 1943 for his political activities, Soedjatmoko moved to Surakarta and practised medicine with his father. In 1947, after Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko and two other youths were deployed to Lake Success, New York, to represent Indonesia at the United Nations (UN). They helped secure international recognition of the country's sovereignty. After his work at the UN, Soedjatmoko attempted to study at Harvard's Littauer Center for Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government); however, he was forced to resign due to pressure from other work, including serving as Indonesia's first charg\\u00e9 d'affaires in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk at the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington, D.C. By 1952 he had returned to Indonesia, where he became involved in the socialist press and joined the Socialist Party of Indonesia. He was elected as a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in 1955, serving until 1959; he married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. However, as President Sukarno's government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government. To avoid censorship, he spent two years as a guest lecturer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and another three in self-imposed unemployment in Indonesia. After Sukarno was replaced by Suharto, Soedjatmoko returned to public service. In 1966 he was sent as one of Indonesia's representatives at the UN, and in 1968 he became Indonesia's ambassador to the US; during this time he received several honorary doctoral degrees. He also advised foreign minister Adam Malik. After returning to Indonesia in 1971, Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks. After the Malari incident in January 1974, Soedjatmoko was held for interrogation for two and a half weeks and accused of masterminding the event. Although eventually released, he could not leave Indonesia for two and a half years.

After being expelled from medical school by the Japanese in 1943 for his political activities, Soedjatmoko moved to Surakarta and practised medicine with his father. In 1947, after Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko and two other youths were deployed to Lake Success, New York, to represent Indonesia at the United Nations (UN). They helped secure international recognition of the country's sovereignty. After his work at the UN, Soedjatmoko attempted to study at Harvard's Littauer Center for Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government); however, he was forced to resign due to pressure from other work, including serving as Indonesia's first charg\\u00e9 d'affaires in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk at the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington, D.C. By 1952 he had returned to Indonesia, where he became involved in the socialist press and joined the Socialist Party of Indonesia. He was elected as a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in 1955, serving until 1959; he married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. However, as President Sukarno's government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government. To avoid censorship, he spent two years as a guest lecturer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and another three in self-imposed unemployment in Indonesia. After Sukarno was replaced by Suharto, Soedjatmoko returned to public service. In 1966 he was sent as one of Indonesia's representatives at the UN, and in 1968 he became Indonesia's ambassador to the US; during this time he received several honorary doctoral degrees. He also advised foreign minister Adam Malik. After returning to Indonesia in 1971, Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks. After the Malari incident in January 1974, Soedjatmoko was held for interrogation for two and a half weeks and accused of masterminding the event. Although eventually released, he could not leave Indonesia for two and a half years. In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding, and in 1980 he was chosen as rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo.

He was born in the town of Zolotonosha, Russian Empire (currently in Ukraine). As an adult he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party but was expelled when he formed a Zionist Socialist Workers Union in Yekaterinoslav. Subsequently, he helped form the Poale Zion party and devoted his life to promoting the party in Russia, Europe, and America. When the Russian social democrats came to power, Borochov returned to Russia in March 1917 to lead the Poale Zion. He became ill and died in Kiev of pneumonia in December 1917. Borochov became highly influential in the Zionist movement because he explained nationalism in general, and Jewish Nationalism in particular in terms of Marxist class struggle and dialectical materialism. Borochov predicted, correctly, that nationalist forces would be more important in determining events than economic and class considerations, especially as concerned the Jews. Borochov argued that the class structure of European Jews resembled an inverted class pyramid where few Jews occupied the productive layers of society as workers. The Jews would migrate from country to country as they were forced out of their chosen professions by a \\\"stychic process\\\" which would ultimately force migration to Palestine, where they would form a proletarian basis in order to carry out Marxist class struggle. A key part of Borochovian ideology was that the Arab and Jewish working classes had a common proletarian interest and would participate in the class struggle together once Jews had returned to Palestine. In his last recorded speech, he said: Many point out the obstacles which we encounter in our colonization work. Some say that the Turkish law hinders our work, others contend that Palestine is insignificantly small, and still others charge us with the odious crime of wishing to oppress and expel the Arabs from Palestine...When the waste lands are prepared for colonization, when modern technique is introduced, and when the other obstacles are removed, there will be sufficient land to accommodate both the Jews and the Arabs. Normal relations between the Jews and Arabs will and must prevail. Borochov, along with Nachman Syrkin is considered a father of socialist Zionism. Borochov's ideas were influential in convincing Jewish youth from Europe to move to Palestine. However, Borochov's theories remained most influential in Eastern Europe, where they formed the basis of the Left Poale Zionist movement which was active in Poland during the interwar years. Indeed, Borochov's vision of class struggle in Palestine was widely viewed as untenable by the 1910s, with Jewish migrants to Palestine struggling to establish an economic foothold and with interclass cooperation seemingly necessary, and his theories dimmed in popularity there. Borochov, for years an advocate for a doctrinaire Marxist Zionism, himself seemed to repudiate his former vision of class struggle in Palestine in speeches towards the end of his life. Borochov insisted that he was a Social Democrat, but Borochov's Left Poale Zion followers continued to vigorously advocate class struggle both in Palestine and eastern Europe, supporting the February Revolution of 1917. Borochov returned to Russia in August 1917 attended the Third All-Russian Poalei Tziyon Party congress to argue for socialist settlement in Palestine, The Poalei Tziyon conference selected Borochov as a delegate the Conference of Nationalities where he issued a paper calling for Russia as a decentralized socialist commonwealth of nations (\\u201cRossiia kak sodruzhestvo narodov\\u201d). Borochov caught pneumonia while on a speaking tour and died in Kiev on December 17, 1917 at the age of 36. The Russian Poale Zion movement split into two factions over attitudes towards the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. The Poale Zion Left formed a \\\"Borochov Brigade\\\" to join the Red Army during the Russian Civil War and ultimately split from the main Poale Zion party to become the Jewish Communist Party (Poalei Zion) in 1919 and would go on to join the Jewish section (Yevsektsiya) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union while the social democratic Right Poale Zion was banned. The international Poale Zion movement also split into left and right factions, which have evolved into the modern Israeli political parties of Mapam (later Meretz) and the Israeli Labor Party respectively. The European branch of the Left Poale Zion movement was effectively destroyed by the early 1950s; many of its members were killed by the Nazis during World War II, and the surviving activists were persecuted and ultimately outlawed under the various post-war Communist regimes. While most Zionists regarded Yiddish as a derivative language characteristic of the Jewish Diaspora and to be abandoned by the Jewish people in favor of Hebrew, Borochov was a committed Yiddishist and Yiddish philologist and wrote extensively on the importance of the language. He is considered the founder of modern Yiddish studies. Borochov\\u2019s contributions were recognized in various ways by the early Jewish settlement in Palestine.

Low was recognized by senior officials for his excellent work and handed a series of scientific assignments in the North. Although his career is dotted with distinguished work, Low is perhaps best remembered as the commander of a 1903-04 Dominion expedition to declare Canada's authority over the Arctic, a journey that resulted in a bestselling book, The Cruise of the Neptune. In 1906, he was appointed director of the Geological Survey of Canada. In 1907, he became the first deputy minister of the Department of Mines. He retired from the department in 1913.

He was born in Montreal. Henderson was selected by Mavor Moore as the CBC Television's first regular national newsreader. Previously, each five-minute news bulletin had been read by a variety of announcers - a situation found to create a disjointed broadcast. By the end of 1954 the national news broadcast was expanded to 15 minutes, twice a day, with film and still pictures accompanying Henderson's narration. Henderson was known for his temper and would swear on the air or make his reading unintelligibly fast when signalled by the director to speed up. On one occasion he walked off the set when the film for a news story was not ready on cue. Henderson was born in Montreal and attended McGill University where he studied music. In 1936 he travelled to England with the hopes of becoming a Shakespearian actor. In London, he studied at the London School of Economics and did further graduate studes at the School of Graduate Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. He spent three years in repertory theatre in England performing the lead in Doctor Faustus and playing Mercutio to Alec Guinness's Romeo in Romeo and Juliet. In 1940, he returned to Canada and joined the announcing staff of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1943, he enlisted in the Canadian Army serving in North Africa and Italy during World War II in the signal corps. Following the war, Henderson rejoined CBC - he applied to work for the broadcaster as an actor but instead found himself working as a staff announcer from 1946 to 1948 when he moved to CFRB to host Headliners which would eventually be syndicated to 24 private radio stations. Henderson was the first Canadian broadcaster to cover the Korean War spending six weeks in the wartorn country in 1950. He subsequently travelled through Europe for three years sending recordings for his Headliners program back to Canada as well as hosting a CBC show, Passport to Adventure. In 1954, he returned to Canada to accept a position at CBC Television as its newsreader in hopes of becoming the country's answer to Edward R. Murrow. Henderson would anchor the broadcast for almost five years and would, unusually for newsreaders at the time, memorize his script rather than read it live. In 1959, Henderson left CBC to work for CHFI-FM and CHCH-TV. He later joined CTV National News as its international affairs expert and weekend news anchor. He left after several years to lecture and write books on international affairs and ran the Larry Henderson School of Television in Toronto. In the 1970s, Henderson joined the Canadian International Development Agency going on assignment to Tanzania where he helped organize the country's national broadcasting system.

He was born in Montreal. Henderson was selected by Mavor Moore as the CBC Television's first regular national newsreader. Previously, each five-minute news bulletin had been read by a variety of announcers - a situation found to create a disjointed broadcast. By the end of 1954 the national news broadcast was expanded to 15 minutes, twice a day, with film and still pictures accompanying Henderson's narration. Henderson was known for his temper and would swear on the air or make his reading unintelligibly fast when signalled by the director to speed up. On one occasion he walked off the set when the film for a news story was not ready on cue. Henderson was born in Montreal and attended McGill University where he studied music. In 1936 he travelled to England with the hopes of becoming a Shakespearian actor. In London, he studied at the London School of Economics and did further graduate studes at the School of Graduate Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. He spent three years in repertory theatre in England performing the lead in Doctor Faustus and playing Mercutio to Alec Guinness's Romeo in Romeo and Juliet. In 1940, he returned to Canada and joined the announcing staff of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1943, he enlisted in the Canadian Army serving in North Africa and Italy during World War II in the signal corps. Following the war, Henderson rejoined CBC - he applied to work for the broadcaster as an actor but instead found himself working as a staff announcer from 1946 to 1948 when he moved to CFRB to host Headliners which would eventually be syndicated to 24 private radio stations. Henderson was the first Canadian broadcaster to cover the Korean War spending six weeks in the wartorn country in 1950. He subsequently travelled through Europe for three years sending recordings for his Headliners program back to Canada as well as hosting a CBC show, Passport to Adventure. In 1954, he returned to Canada to accept a position at CBC Television as its newsreader in hopes of becoming the country's answer to Edward R. Murrow. Henderson would anchor the broadcast for almost five years and would, unusually for newsreaders at the time, memorize his script rather than read it live. In 1959, Henderson left CBC to work for CHFI-FM and CHCH-TV. He later joined CTV National News as its international affairs expert and weekend news anchor.
